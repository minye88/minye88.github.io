									My name is Min Ye!<br/></p>
								<p>
								<p>
									I am currently a fourth-year student at DigiPen Singapore, pursuing a BS in Computer Science in Interactive Media and Game Development degree. Though I was formerly studying accountancy in polytechnic, 
									I realized that I was not at all interested in the business, and decided to start a career in the field that I love - video games. Thus, after graduating from polytechnic, I took the risk and jumped to  
									a game developement course despite not knowing a single thing about computer science or programming. I can now confidently say that I have no regrets because I am enjoying programming and making games.<br/><br/>
									Do keep an eye on my game projects page as I will continue to upload new games from time to time. Hope you have fun trying them out!!!<br/><br/>
									Keep scrolling for some trivia about me, we may have some interests in common!

										<h2><a>Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade<br/></a></h2>			
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/fe1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, or FE7, was probably one of the first few games I have ever played in my life, aside from Pokemon. When a friend in primary school lent it to me, I got absolutely hooked onto this more-punishing-than-my-mother strategy turn-based game.	
									</p>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/fe2.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Being the silly kid that I was, I took ages to beat the game because I refused to let even a single character die. To me, permadeath didn't mean losing a character forever, it meant hard resetting and doing the level all over again.
										Having the entire ensemble make it through chapter by chapter just gave me a warm fuzzy feeling that was simply comforting. 
									</p>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/fe3.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Another reason why I love this game so much was the art style. I found the pixelised sprites and combat animations really appealing and I think it still looks great, even by today's standards. You know it's good when you don't skip
										the combat animation even after seeing it a million times. <br/><br/> Also the character recuitment soundtrack was bomb. 
									</p>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/fe4.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										FE7 was a core part of my childhood and I still go back to play it from time to time, together with Sacred Stones. FE7 came with a compelling story, intimate characters, simple yet potentially chaotic combat mechanics, and great art & music.
										Perhaps it's just nostalgia, but this game had a charm that the modern Fire Emblem games just could not emulate.
